            In general, trends can be divided into two big categories. First, there are global (long-term) trends that
            concern IT giants and are designed for a mass audience. Second, short-term trends, categories that are
            growing and likely need to be implemented in the next 1-2 years.</p>

            them in real life every day. We witness an increase in demand for IoT gadgets and systems which, naturally,

            <p>
              In the age of the internet, even clothes are getting “smart.” For the first time, people got serious about
              it when Google and Levi’s introduced a ”smart” jacket. The jacket has a small “smart” sensor unit on the
              sleeve, designed to control your Smartphone.<a href="../blog" class="more">(more)</a>
